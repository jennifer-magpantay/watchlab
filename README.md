# watchlab

## Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, Glide.js and Parcel.

## Goals

Develop a rensposive landing page based on desing provided.

## Status

Finished.

## Considerations

- The slider at the intro section is displayed only in the laptop version, avoiding over content in small screens and keeping the clean design of the page;
- A second version of the landing page would surely consider contrast for most of the texts, making sure it is 100% readable for all types of visitors.
